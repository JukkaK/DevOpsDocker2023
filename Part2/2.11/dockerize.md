My development (work) projects for the past 3 years have been:

- Setting up yaml pipelines and
- Deploying PaaS Infrastructure-as-Code

Sadly neither of them really is really ideal for containerization, so I just generated a project with react frontend with the new Azure Developer CLI. It came with existing dockerfile, so I just slapped a docker-compose.yml on top of it. 

I'm planning on doing the fullstack MOOC next, so I guess I'll try to out a developer container then, or perhaps try out [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
